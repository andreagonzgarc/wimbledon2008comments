For Federer to win 6 in a row would have been ridiculous, even 6 in 7 finals was nuts. From memory most people actually wanted Nadal to win this match because Federer's dominance was getting out of hand."

Imagine it, “First out, from Mallorca Sunny Spain, he is a four time French Open champion appearing in his third consecutive Wimbledon final, introducing the undisputed King Of Clay, Rafael Nadal!”  (Rafa walks out) “His opponent from Basel Switzerland, he is a 12 time Grand Slam champion including matching the remarkable achievement of five consecutive Wimbledon championships. He is regarded by many as the greatest player of all time, please welcome the defending and undisputed Wimbledon champion, the Fedex Express, Roger Federer!” (Roger enters.) (After the warm-up)
“The officials are ready, the players are ready, for those in centre court, for those gathered on the Hill, and for the millions watching around the world there is only one thing left to say, Ladies and Gentlemen, LETS GET READY TO RUMBLE!!” Yes I do sometimes have too much time on my hands 😂."

  Except Nadal.   I remember this day, me and my friends on our feet on the ranch. It was like millions of people could be heard in the air around the world. Idk if anyone knew who they wanted to win.  This transcended the game. I remember aggosi? Who was commentating in america was in tears.  It was love of the sport, and an honor to witness like few other events in sports history.  Mad respect for both players.  Some things cant be explained nor ever repeated.

Number 1 is Sinner, scheduled to play Shelton tomorrow the 7th. Federer has retired, Nadal withdrew from this Wimbledon, is preparing for the Olympics in Paris. Curious what the stats will be 16 years from now, to the day. Will YouTube even still be around?"

142,2024-07-01 08:23:33,@antrikshluthra6599,27:17 I can see what Federer was talking about in the commencement speech at Dartmouth. There was a mental barrier at the start of the match.
143,2024-06-27 09:27:16,@fg92626,lol even the claycourt bully owned Federer at Wimbledon
144,2024-06-26 22:56:50,@jimsheldon3788,This win was so Gargantuan to tennis because Roger Federer was winning everything and nobody was interested. Tennis became stagnant. Then a young beast Rafa Nadal took out the King. Fans loved it because it was some of the best Tennis Matches ever! Rafa Nadal will always be my favorite Tennis player.

329,2023-03-26 03:06:40,@shivabalannagakumaran6019,My prediction: Rafael Nadal successfully ends Novak Djokovic's Wimbledon Reign in 2023 (the 2023 Australian Open was Novak's last grand slam title he will ever win in his career (just like Roger Federer's last grand slam title happened in 2018 in Australia)) and Rafael Nadal wins his 3rd Wimbledon Title in 2023 especially since its 13 years since his 2nd title in 2010 (and that's the same number of years between Rafael Nadal's 1st and historic 2nd Australian Open title in 2009 and 2022 respectively.)

2. Djokovic is the greatest in machine-like precision tennis!
3. Nadal is an ordinary man who did extraordinary things: a natural right-hander who excelled with his left hand; a guy with a physique that is not best for tennis who is almost always the underdog on grass and hard courts yet able to beat the likes of Federer on Wimbledon grass and Djokovic on US Open hard court relying on his great fighting heart and awesome tenacity! One of the greatest comeback players on tour and could be the greatest fighter on court who is humble in victory and gracious in defeat never smashing a racket! ❤️"

In one of the later games he even pauses trying to catch the referee’s attention to the lower light conditions.   The conditions were the same for Nadal.

It's not just that he took down Prime federer. It's not just that he took down Prime Federer on his best surface.

But to adjust from Roland garros in the clay to the grass at Wimbledon in just a few weeks is very difficult to do.

And this achievement came at the perfect time.

Also, for many tennis bands this was the moment where Nadal was viewed differently.

He was no longer just this guy who only won on clay. This guy was going to be here to stay, on surfaces outside of clay. This guy was going to be different."

But speaking of perfection...Nadal's timing between serves was annoying the whole match and simply turned disgusting (as Roger elegantly pointed out during that game) in that last game. 
Close to 40 seconds between each point. It's the wimbledon final and all, he's probably the greatest winner to ever play the game and yada yada. Ok. 
But Tennis is for a good part a game of focus, pace and rithm. That slowness is simply disrespectful of opponent and ultmately of the game itself.

But he won, so hail to the champ :/

The amount of greatness at stake at this match was immeasurable. No other match comes close. Every shot that was hit had so much intent. 

Nadal was incredibly clutch in the first two sets and the final set. Federer did amazingly well to fight back. He resisted Nadal very well. This was the first time a match got to Federer. I think he cried after the match. I used to hate Federer and his cult-like fans. I thought his game was way too overrated and hyped. I still think it is a bit overhyped for being ""balletic"". He makes far too many unforced errors and attacks prematurely, much to my liking. But over the years, I have come to appreciate Federer's game and the brilliance behind it. It's a combination of the old and new tennis. 

This match cemented Nadal as the arch-rival of Federer."

Nadal's accomplishment was monumental because of Federer's incomparable dominance of tennis in general till this tournament. Nadal's genius on clay was often used as a point of weakness for him, because of the difficulty in adapting to such a quick surface two weeks after the clay season. Many did say that 2007 was his best chance for Wimbledon glory. But he proved everyone wrong. Federer's resilience in the middle of the match is the stuff of legend, specially considering the spanking he had received at the hands of the Spaniard a mere month ago in Paris. Add that to the fact that this was a Centre Court being renovated and it had the last rain delays in its glorious history, the physicality that even Federer, at his imperious best, had to display, the resurrection of Nadal's nightmares from the last two games of the 5th set of 2007, this was a classic that might as well have been written by Shakespeare. What's more, towards the end of the match, in the darkness, when the flashlights were going crazy, and Federer was requesting people to stop with the interference, it was a scene which was eerily similar to Pete Sampras doing the same in his loss to Federer back in 2001. What a privilege to watch this as a 17 year old."

564,2022-02-08 11:15:06,@aha3885,"Nadal has played 63 GS, Nole 65, Roger 80. Rafa has won 21. Roger won his first ATP match at 17 years old, same as Nole. They won their first ATP title at 19 years old, Roger won his first GS with 21 years and 11 months. Nole, with 20 years and 7 months. Roger completed the GS at 27 years old, Nole did it at 29 years old. 

Nadal won his first ATP match at 15 years old. At 16 years old, he won Albert Costa and Carlos Moyá, two former RG champions, Moyá n°4 atp at the moment. He beated them in a Masters 1000. And an ATP 500. The next year he won his first ATP title, beated prime Federer on hard, and broke his feet for the first time, playing Estoril. He missed his first RG because that injurie, and probably win it with just turned 18 years old. That year the final was Coria vs Gaudio. After that bad time, he was able to recover in a few months. And played the Davis Cup final vs EEUU, winning the last point. With 18 years and six months of age, the youngest player ever doing that. Next year, he won his first GS with 19 years and two days of age. 

He completed the GS at 24 years old. The youngest player ever. Three less than Roger, five less than Nole. By then, Rafa was already Olympic champion. On hard court. He just need 37 wins on clay to became the only player with +500 w. on hard, and clay. He is the third player with most wins on clay, and the fourth on hard. No other player is in both top ten. He has won at least one ATP title nineteen years on a row. 2004 - ? It's a record. He has won two or more ATP titles eighteen years on a row. 2005 - ? It's a record. He is the only player with + 800 consecutive weeks in ATP top ten. 854. Jimmy Connors has 789, Roger 734. Nole is not even close. When Rafa came to the top ten, Dennis Shapovalov had 4 years old. Daniil Medvedev, 9 years old. Matteo Berretini 9 years old. The four has seen each other in Melbourne few days ago. Seventeen years later. Rafa won. 

And remember. All the crazy things he was able to do, and still is...all that, he did it with a broken foot since 2004. In my book, 100% 🐐"

The Swiss suffered from mononucleosis  that year and that caused his level to drop and he had to play catch up in training. Granted Fed was still good because, simply put, he is Roger freakin Federer and even a lower level of Federer is still better than most players. However, against all-time great players like Nadal is where it showed the most. No way would a top level Federer lose like he did to Nadal in the Roland Garros 2008 final. It's ridiculous to fathom peak Federer being down 2 sets to love in his best surface to a clay court specialist. Nadal obviously still did well to win this match, considering beating any version of Federer on grass is not easy. Grandpa Fed ousting Nadal in 4 in 2019 is probably how this match would have gone had peak Fed shown up."

There have been at least a dozen GS matches where the quality was better than this. Yes surely no match can match the drama and the stakes involved in this one but calling it the greatest GS final in terms of quality is just not right. This match did not even deserve the 5th set.

904,2020-09-29 15:37:18,@mitchell4745,This match proved for me that Nadal is the GOAT. Prime Nadal vs Prime Federer and Nadal bested Federer om his own court. If it wasn’t for his injuries Nadal would have won the most grand slams. But i can also agree that they are both on the same level. I don’t see djoko as equal because the majority of his grand slams are in the last 7-8 years where Federer has been aging and Nadal as well as aging can’t keep up because of his injury history.

So whats better? Sampras just came to my  mind.

Nobody broke serve in the entire four-set match!  Two totally different playing styles.  Shame that match had to end with four tie breakers because had they played under old rules (i.e., each set had to be won by margin of two), the first set alone would have been over 100-100+.

1) loss vs. Nadal (2008 Wimbledon singles final)
2) loss vs. Djokovic (2019 Wimbledon singles final) despite being 37 years young. 
3) win vs. Robin Söderling (2009 French Open singles final) and only major title on clay."
1190,2019-07-15 04:54:04,@furiousg3orge,"This match. THIS beautiful spectacle was the spark that ushered in the golden age of tennis that continues to this very day. Federer, Djokovic, and Nadal have collectively squandered an entire generation of incredibly talented athletes in pursuit of THIS level of greatness, and only time will tell which of the titans can truly call this era his own. 

Then again, can any of the big three truly lay claim to this era? Can one definitely argue that one man climbed to the game's height of heights in spite of the other two? The Spaniard, the Serb, and the Swiss will be remembered as the game's trifecta of checks and balances, each man sharpening the next with every game, set and match played among them. 

We are beyond blessed to bear witness to the lasting legacy of this match and to have experienced in real time what future generations will never remember."

That year I had some rather serious health issues going on affecting my ability to function on a daily basis.  In order to deal with one of them it meant correcting an issue with my Right foot.  Yes, that meant having Surgery so while this match was going on I was recovering from that Surgery.  As sometimes happens when Surgery occurs the Medications can make one groggy for a few days or so.  But I wanted to see this Match.  What was interesting is that I told my mom I wanted to watch this Match and she got excited since I had slept a lot that day already.  I was able to watch this entire Match without getting sicker."

How can anyone say FEDERER is ""THE"" GOAT if he is not even the best of his own generation, just check the H2H against NADAL and DJOKOVIC. (June 2019 before Wimbledon)

All matches:
NADAL           24 - 15   FEDERER
DJOKOVIC   25 - 22   FEDERER

GS Finals:
NADAL           6 - 3   FEDERER
DJOKOVIC   3 - 1   FEDERER

All Finals:
NADAL           14 - 10   FEDERER
DJOKOVIC    12 -   6   FEDERER

Yeah he has more GS titles, but he won his first 7 before NADAL or Djokovic came along. 
He played 13 GS Finals against his two main rivals and lost 9
He won 16 out of 17 when facing other players in GS Finals. 94.1% winning but it drops to 30.7% against Rafa/Nole"

Nunca pudo devolverle la gentileza en una final de RG, ni tan siquiera pudo llevarlo al quinto set,, es más, ni siquiera pudo con ese Rafa jovencito de 19, 20 años, la mejor chance de derrotarlo fue en 2005, un Rafa inexperto en rondas finales de gs contra otro que ya era número 1 y que ya sabía lo que es ganar GS."

1456,2019-01-08 13:10:08,@shaunhumphreys6714,"I feel the net rushing federer at one point, which really rushed rafa nadal's backhand, and nadal doesnt like having to hit with a low backlift, if he could have kept that up, and limited the backcourt exchanges. As Tim Henman said, federer should be serve volleying against nadal. Yes the courts aren't as quick and the ball doesnt skid as low as 2002-3, but serve volley on first serve at least and coming to the net on nadal's second serves. I feel federer didnt have enough faith with that tactic to stick to it, we see though how effective federer is at winning short points, where he gets inside the service square (sorry dont know proper name for it) and hits a forehand down the line. Even with nadal's pace  he doesnt move for the ball at all. The tactic should be to volley to nadals backhand which of course is less dangerous than a nadal forehand passing shot. I think federer employed this strategy excellently at australian open 2018, really rushing nadal. Except at aussie 2018, roger's backhand return of serve was ridiculous-half volleyed, returned deep to nadal, so nadal's strategy of serving to nadals backhand was neutralised. I actually think for me, the australian opwn 2018 was a far better quality match, some longer rallies with less unforced errors, and the points were still end to end attacking stuff (not like djokovic vs murray) and there were some more memorable amazing shots by both players and the circumstances of federer and nadal renewing their rivlary in a major final after knowing thinking it would happen again, made that aussie open their greatest match. nadal was really raw in 2006 wimbledon final so faacinating to watch, and i think the 2007 final better on the eye. It's amazing people say nadals serve is a weakness, well federer has more problems breaking nadal's serve than kevin anderson's or any other of the biggest servers in 2017-18. Nadal's lefty serve is a [problem and the amount of away spin he gets on his down the line serve is really hard not just for federer, but djokovic is usually pulled all over the place by it. Percentage wise in recent years nadal has the best second serve in men's tennis, and the like the big servers he backs up his first serve with big forehands."

1543,2018-08-01 12:49:38,@martingunzel7913,"10 years after, there are still no greater players than these two. It is very impressive, but it is also very frustrating to see that there is no real successor in sight: In the 80s there were Becker, Lendl and McEnroe; in the 90s there were Sampras and Agassi; in the 2000s there were Federer and Nadal, accompanied by Djokovic, Murray and Wawrinka in the  And now? Where are the great players of the future? I don´t see ANYONE!  A. Zverev and D. Thiem are exaggerated - they don´t seem to be able to win a major; D Thiem is only a clay-player (who still, in his mid-twenties, has absolutely no chance against Rafa on clay); Zverev is a catastrophe at majors.

It is very, very disappointing to see!"

The match lasted 5 sets with a rain delay. With only 3 Major titles between them, the #Fedal rivalry began in 2004 at the Miami Open and is still going strong"

I find it weird when people say 2012 ao slugfest a total pushing style match is better than this. I dont think so. It is match between best shotmaker and ulltimate defender. love it. Hate dulll for winning this but he is a legend. Hope roger n dull face each other in 2018 final and rogie wins it.
